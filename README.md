# 🌐 Amaan Rahman — Portfolio

This repository contains my personal portfolio website.

I built it the way I try to understand things in mathematics:  
start simple, avoid unnecessary abstraction, and make sure every part actually makes sense.

No frameworks pretending to be magic.  
No build steps hiding what’s really happening.  
Just plain HTML, CSS (via Tailwind CDN), and a bit of JavaScript — so anyone can read it, modify it, and learn from it.

## What this website is

- A **personal portfolio** showcasing my interests in:
  - Mathematics
  - Computing
  - Visualization
  - Scientific thinking
- A place where I explain *what I do* rather than *what buzzwords I know*
- A fully **static website**, hosted on **Vercel**
